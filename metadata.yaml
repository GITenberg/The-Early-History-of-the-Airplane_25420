description: The Wright brothers, Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867-1912), were
  two Americans who are generally credited with inventing and building the world's
  first successful airplane and making the first controlled, powered and sustained
  heavier-than-air human flight in 1903.  In the two years afterward, the brothers
  developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft.  Although
  not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the
  first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed wing flight possible.  The brother's
  fundamental breakthrough was their invention of "three axis-control," which enabled
  the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.
